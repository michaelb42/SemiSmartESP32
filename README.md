This is an enhanced firmware implementation for the Semi Smart PCB addon designed by Voxel3D. The Semi Smart is a heated addon for the CoreBoxx enclosure system. This firmware provides enhanced features and improved functionality while maintaining compatibility with the original hardware design.

🎯 Overview

The 3DMonkey Enhanced Semi Smart firmware is an environmental controller firmware that maintains optimal conditions inside the enclosure. It features dual operation modes, PID temperature control, intelligent fan management, thermal safety systems, and a three-state system (OFF, STANDBY, ON) for complete control.

🔧 System States

The system operates in three distinct states:

**SYSTEM_OFF**: Complete shutdown
- No fan operation
- No heater operation
- No air cycling

**SYSTEM_STANDBY**: Low-power standby mode
- Periodic air cycling (15s on, 5min off)
- No heating
- Maintains air circulation
- Display shows "Standby" status
- Control mode selection available (USER/AUTO)

**SYSTEM_ON**: Full operation
- Active temperature control
- Proportional fan operation
- Full PID control
- Display shows operational data

State Transitions

**Button Logic**:
- **Short press ACTION**: OFF ↔ STANDBY (in any control mode)
